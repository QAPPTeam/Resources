# Pull Requests
## How to open a pull request
So you just finished working on some killer feature, and now it's time to open a Github `pull request`. First, all this is assuming that you are on your feature branch. To make sure, you can run
```
git branch
```
Make sure that you have everything commited and nothing in staged/unstaged.
```
git push origin feature-branch
```
Now open the Github repo for the project.
Go to `Pull Request` select New, and where it says "compare: master", click it, and from the drop-down select your feature branch.

Now you should be able to be greeted with an editor. Describe in a few sentences what you did in these changes. Descriptions are important since they give reviewers context. It's also nice when reviewing that you include screenshots if you are doing anything related to UI Work.
